/**
 * Composio bridge — thin wrapper that turns "ask the agent to probe
 * Composio connection state" into a single async function.
 *
 * The Loop is fully agentic: the agent at `/api/native/agent` is the
 * only component that talks to Composio (via the `composio` skill and
 * `composio` CLI). This module does NOT call Composio's REST API
 * directly — doing so would require a parallel `COMPOSIO_API_KEY` and
 * duplicate the agent's discovery work.
 *
 * The bridge exists so non-tick callers (the dev panel's "check
 * connections" button, the `?refresh=1` route param) can ask for a
 * fresh connector snapshot without going through a full tick (which
 * also pulls signals, enriches, classifies, etc.). It does this by
 * posting a small "probe only" prompt to the same `/api/native/agent`
 * endpoint the tick uses; the agent runs the same §1 of the tick
 * prompt (discover which Composio surfaces are reachable), returns
 * the `connectors` block as its final assistant response, and we
 * persist + return it.
 *
 * The result is shape-compatible with `ConnectorEntry[]` from
 * `types.ts`; persistence is the same `writeConnectorSnapshot` the
 * tick uses, so the cache stays single-source.

  return `You are running a **connector probe** for the OpenRice Loop. Your job is to inspect active Composio surfaces, identify which of the toolkits below have at least one healthy connected account, and return one structured JSON object as your final assistant response. NO signal pull, NO classify, NO decision persist — just the connector snapshot.

# Available Composio surfaces — work through ALL of them before giving up

You MUST attempt every surface below, **in order**, even if an earlier surface errors. A non-zero exit, a "command not found", an exception from the skill runtime, or a malformed response from any one surface is NEVER sufficient reason to declare the probe done. Only after steps 1, 2, and 3 have all failed may you fall through to step 4.

  1. **CLI reachable?** — Run \`Bash(composio whoami)\`. This is the cheapest sanity check; if it succeeds, the CLI is on \`$PATH\` and the user's API key is valid. Record this surface as \`"cli"\` in \`surfaces_used\`.

  2. **CLI connections snapshot** — Run \`Bash(composio connections list)\` (and, for a per-account breakdown, \`Bash(composio manage connected-accounts list --status ACTIVE)\`). It returns JSON of the form \`{ "<toolkit>": [{ "status": "ACTIVE", "word_id": "...", ... }, ...] }\`. Treat entries with \`status === "ACTIVE"\` as healthy connections; everything else as disconnected. Combine this result into the per-toolkit \`connected\` / \`accountCount\` / \`accounts\` / \`lastError\` fields. Each ACTIVE account becomes one \`accounts\` entry with its non-secret \`{ id, label }\` (id = \`connected_account_id\` / \`word_id\`; label = the account email / handle when present). NEVER include tokens or secrets.

  3. **\`composio\` skill** — Run \`Skill composio connections list\`. Independent of the CLI; in sandboxed shells (or when \`composio\` is not on \`$PATH\`) this may be the only surface that returns data. If step 1 or 2 already succeeded, still run this step — its result can confirm or contradict the CLI.

  4. **No surface reachable** — ONLY reach this step when steps 1, 2, and 3 ALL failed. Report \`surfaces_used: []\` and set every non-local-only entry to \`connected: false\` with \`lastError: "no composio surface reachable"\`.

If multiple surfaces return data, merge them: a toolkit with at least one ACTIVE / healthy report from ANY surface counts as \`connected: true\` with that surface's \`accountCount\` and merged \`accounts\` (dedupe accounts by \`id\`). A later surface's failure does not invalidate an earlier surface's success.

# Codex OpenRice Plugin

**Open-source AI coworker, built to protect your attention.**

Run OpenRice from inside OpenAI Codex CLI.

[OpenRice](https://github.com/melandlabs/openloomi) is a local-first desktop app that holds your memory, runs tasks in the
background, and talks to your connected apps (Gmail, Slack, GitHub, Calendar,
Linear, …). This plugin turns Codex into a front-end for that local runtime —
you chat with Codex, and Codex hands work off to OpenRice instead of doing
everything itself.

You keep using Codex the way you already do. OpenRice runs next to it, on
your machine.

---

## What you can do with it

- **Ask Codex about your work.** "What did I work on last Tuesday?" — Codex
  pulls the answer from OpenRice's local memory instead of guessing.
- **Hand tasks off for follow-up.** "Send this to Loomi so it reminds me about
  it tomorrow" — the task goes into OpenRice's loop and pings you when it's
  ready.
- **Route Codex through OpenRice.** When OpenRice answers, it can use your
  Codex CLI runtime under the hood, so you only configure one runtime.
- **Trigger OpenRice workflows from chat.** Memory, loop, and connectors
  are all exposed as Codex skills — type `@OpenRice …` and go.

OpenRice still owns the heavy lifting: local memory storage, connector
credentials, scheduled tasks, the desktop UI, secrets. Codex just gets a
doorway into all of it.

---

## Install the plugin

You need a Codex build that supports `codex plugin marketplace` (Codex CLI
0.144 or newer). Pick the install path that matches your workflow.

### Install from GitHub

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add melandlabs/plugins && codex plugin add openloomi@openloomi
```

Paste the whole line into a Codex shell — it adds the slim
[`melandlabs/plugins`](https://github.com/melandlabs/plugins) marketplace
(only the plugin payloads) and installs the `openloomi` plugin in one go.
Then **restart Codex** and start a new thread so the cache is refreshed,
and ask `@OpenRice Run first-use setup.` (or
`node ~/.codex/plugins/cache/openloomi/openloomi/<version>/scripts/loomi-bridge.mjs setup --yes`
— find the installed `<version>` with
`ls ~/.codex/plugins/cache/openloomi/openloomi/`) to wire up the desktop
app.

Codex installs the plugin into
`~/.codex/plugins/cache/openloomi/openloomi/<version>`.

### Install from a local checkout (contributors)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/melandlabs/plugins.git && cd plugins && codex plugin marketplace add . && codex plugin add openloomi@openloomi
```

The `.` argument tells Codex to use the repo root as a local marketplace;
plugin resolution lands on `./openloomi/codex`. From a contributor checkout,
the bridge script lives at `./openloomi/codex/scripts/loomi-bridge.mjs`.

When you change files under `openloomi/codex/` and want to pick up your edits,
force a re-snapshot:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace remove openloomi && codex plugin marketplace add . && codex plugin add openloomi@openloomi
```

Either way, **restart Codex and start a new thread** after installing — Codex
only picks up the new plugin when a fresh process loads the cache.

### Requirements

- Codex CLI 0.144+ with `codex plugin marketplace` support.
- Network access to `github.com` (for the GitHub install path), or a writable
  checkout of the OpenRice repo (for the local path).
- **OpenRice Desktop installed** — or a source build that produces the
  OpenRice Desktop app — for anything beyond setup guidance and workflow
  discovery. Without it, the plugin can still report readiness and walk you
  through installation, but loop, memory, and connector tasks can't
  actually run.
- Codex CLI on your `PATH` (e.g. `brew install --cask codex` or
  `npm i -g @openai/codex`) if you want OpenRice to route through your
  Codex runtime.

---

## Set up OpenRice Desktop

If you already have OpenRice Desktop running, you can skip to the next
section. Otherwise the plugin can do the whole first-use setup for you.

From any new Codex thread, ask:

```text
@OpenRice Run first-use setup.
```

The setup wizard walks a small state machine in one call:

1. **Check readiness** — is OpenRice installed? Is the desktop app reachable?
2. **Install** (if needed) — downloads the official GitHub release. _Requires
   `--yes` or `--confirm`; it never installs silently._
3. **Wire the Codex runtime** — sets `OPENLOOMI_AGENT_PROVIDER=codex` so
   OpenRice reuses your Codex CLI.
4. **Launch OpenRice Desktop** — opens the app and waits for the local API.
5. **Mint a guest/session token** — writes `~/.openloomi/token`.
6. **Re-check readiness** — confirms every step stuck.

If the install step needs permission, type:

```text
@OpenRice Run first-use setup with --yes so the install step can proceed.
```

The wizard never auto-installs from unofficial artifacts, never builds from
source on your behalf, and never asks for API keys in chat — secrets are
always entered inside OpenRice-owned UI.

Codex sandboxing can block GitHub release lookup/download, writes to system
application directories such as `/Applications`, installer execution, and GUI
launching. On a likely sandbox-related network or permission failure, request
approval and retry the same bridge command outside the sandbox before treating
the release URL as unavailable or the installer as broken. Keep the retry on
`loomi-bridge`; do not bypass its official-artifact allowlist and verification.

You can run the same wizard from a terminal. After the GitHub install the
bridge lives at the marketplace cache path; for a local contributor checkout
it lives at `./openloomi/codex/scripts/loomi-bridge.mjs`.

```bash
# GitHub install:
node ~/.codex/plugins/cache/openloomi/openloomi/<version>/scripts/loomi-bridge.mjs setup --yes
# Local contributor checkout:
node ./openloomi/codex/scripts/loomi-bridge.mjs setup --yes
```

`setup` is **idempotent** — run it again any time to recover from a dropped
session, re-apply the runtime env after a Codex upgrade, or confirm everything
still resolves to `READY`.

---

## Verify it's working

Open a fresh Codex thread and try one of these prompts:

```text
@OpenRice Check whether OpenRice is ready.
```

```text
@OpenRice Show the OpenRice workflows available from Codex.
```

```text
@OpenRice Use Loomi to summarize the current task in one sentence.
```

A fully prepared environment answers with something like:

```text
installed: true
appPath: /Applications/OpenRice.app
tokenPresent: true
executionProviderReady: true
executionProviderSource: native_codex_runtime
ready: true
nextAction: null
```

If anything in that block is `false`, jump to the troubleshooting section
below.

## End-to-end user flow

> **Want to see what this looks like in motion?** Read the dedicated
> [Tour guide →](https://openloomi.ai/docs/plugins/codex) — from "ask Codex to install
> the plugin" through "custom Loop type fires on the next decision".

The TL;DR of the full path: **install the plugin → launch Codex with
`--plugin-dir plugins/codex` → see the Loomi Pet pop on the desktop
(fox theme) → flip the theme to capybara via the right-click menu →
call `@OpenRice status` for the canonical JSON → the bundled Codex
hooks drive the pet through every event automatically → connect
external apps via `@OpenRice connectors` → and finally watch OpenRice's
Loop surface decision cards in the desktop app** — all driven by
prompts you typed in Codex.

The screenshots in the Tour guide are the canonical reference for the
visual state of the system at every step. The remainder of this README is
for command behavior, configuration, and contributor reference.

---

## What you can ask Codex

Once the plugin is enabled and OpenRice is ready, treat `@OpenRice` as a
front door into the local runtime. A few patterns that usually work:

```text
@OpenRice Use the memory workflow to recall relevant context.
@OpenRice Use the loop workflow to plan the next step.
@OpenRice Check connector readiness for this task.
```

The workflow skills are intentionally thin — they route your request into the
right OpenRice surface. Anything OpenRice's local runtime doesn't support
yet comes back as a polite "not yet supported here" rather than a silent
fallback inside Codex.

---

## If something goes wrong

### "OpenRice is not installed"

Install the packaged OpenRice Desktop release, or point the plugin at an
existing install:

```bash
export OPENLOOMI_INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/openloomi
export OPENLOOMI_APP=/path/to/openloomi/desktop/binary
```

### "SOURCE_FOUND_APP_NOT_BUILT"

You have a source checkout but the desktop app hasn't been built yet. The
plugin does not build from source automatically. Either build the desktop
binary per `apps/web/src-tauri/README.md` or install the packaged release.

### "SESSION_INITIALIZATION_REQUIRED"

OpenRice is installed but the local guest/session token is missing. Open
OpenRice Desktop once so it can mint a guest session, then re-run:

```bash
# GitHub install:
node ~/.codex/plugins/cache/openloomi/openloomi/<version>/scripts/loomi-bridge.mjs setup
# Local contributor checkout:
node ./openloomi/codex/scripts/loomi-bridge.mjs setup
```

The token lives at `~/.openloomi/token`. Delete it to force a re-mint.

### "native runtime not detected"

The bridge expected the OpenRice Desktop web server to advertise a Codex
agent at `/api/native/providers`. Two ways forward, in order of preference:

1. **Route OpenRice through your Codex runtime.** The `setup` wizard does
   this by default; once `OPENLOOMI_AGENT_PROVIDER=codex` is set and you've
   restarted OpenRice Desktop, the native Codex runtime becomes active and
   no extra setup is needed.
2. **Open OpenRice Desktop** so its web server is reachable at the URL the
   bridge probes, then re-run `setup-status`.

### Codex still shows an old plugin version

Remove and re-add the marketplace, restart Codex, and start a new thread. The
cached copy lives at
`~/.codex/plugins/cache/openloomi/openloomi/<version>`.

### Default agent still says `claude`

If you ran the bridge's `setup` wizard end-to-end, the env var change is
already applied **and** the running desktop app has been auto-restarted so
the freshly forked web server inherits it — you should not need to Quit+
Reopen by hand. If you instead ran `set-codex-runtime-env` outside of
setup (for example via a manual CLI invocation), the wizard's auto-restart
is not in the loop and you'll need to **quit and reopen OpenRice Desktop**
yourself. To confirm the env actually landed in either case:

```bash
launchctl getenv OPENLOOMI_AGENT_PROVIDER
```

---

## (Optional) Route OpenRice through your Codex CLI

By default the packaged OpenRice desktop app routes chat and agent requests
through Claude. If you'd rather have it use your existing Codex CLI runtime —
so you don't need a second AI key for Codex-driven workflows — set
`OPENLOOMI_AGENT_PROVIDER=codex` in the environment the desktop app actually
inherits.

This is the recommended path for first-time Codex-plugin users.

> **You usually don't need to do this by hand.** Whenever the bridge
> launches the OpenRice Desktop app (during `setup` or
> `initialize-session`), it already wires `OPENLOOMI_AGENT_PROVIDER=codex`
> into the launchd environment _before_ the app starts, so a clean install
> picks up the Codex runtime on first open. The manual tiers below are for
> when you want to change or persist the value independently of a launch,
> or on Windows where auto-wiring isn't supported.

> The same launch path also sets `OPENLOOMI_LAUNCH_MODE=plugin` (via
> `launchctl setenv` on macOS, injected into the spawn `env` block on
> Linux/Windows). The desktop reads this to route pet left-clicks to
> the compact status card instead of the main dashboard — the plugin
> already owns the chat conversation in your terminal, so opening the
> main window alongside the pet would surface "two dialogs" for the
> same chat. The pet right-click menu and the card's "Open in
> dashboard" CTA remain as explicit escape hatches to the main
> window. Standalone sessions (icon double-click) leave the env
> unset, so the pet click continues to open the dashboard directly.
> This flag is intentionally separate from `OPENLOOMI_AGENT_PROVIDER`
> so it cannot clobber a user-set provider choice.
>
> The `setup` wizard records both env writes inside its `launch`
> audit step as `providerEnv` (the main write) and `launchModeEnv`
> (the side-band), each carrying `{ ok, key, after, reason }`.
> Operators reading `steps[]` can confirm whether the wizard actually
> tagged the desktop process. Side-band failures are non-fatal
> (`reason: "failed"`) — the spawn still succeeds and the pet click
> falls back to standalone behaviour — so they show up as a record
> detail rather than a `setup` stop condition.

### How to make the env switch stick

The desktop app's web server runs inside the GUI launchd session on macOS (a
separate systemd user session on Linux), **not** in your terminal — so a
shell `export` won't reach it. Three tiers, each more durable than the last:

1. **In-process only** — `export OPENLOOMI_AGENT_PROVIDER=codex` in a
   terminal. Reaches that shell and its children only; the OpenRice web
   server does **not** see it.
2. **This session only (transient)** —

   ```bash
   # GitHub install:
   node ~/.codex/plugins/cache/openloomi/openloomi/<version>/scripts/loomi-bridge.mjs set-codex-runtime-env codex
   # Local contributor checkout:
   node ./openloomi/codex/scripts/loomi-bridge.mjs set-codex-runtime-env codex
   ```

   Writes `launchctl setenv OPENLOOMI_AGENT_PROVIDER codex` in the GUI
   launchd domain on macOS, or `~/.config/environment.d/openloomi-codex.conf`
   on Linux. The currently running OpenRice app does **not** see the change
   until you quit and reopen it; the value is lost on next logout/reboot.

3. **Persistent (recommended)** —

   ```bash
   # GitHub install:
   node ~/.codex/plugins/cache/openloomi/openloomi/<version>/scripts/loomi-bridge.mjs set-codex-runtime-env codex --persist
   # Local contributor checkout:
   node ./openloomi/codex/scripts/loomi-bridge.mjs set-codex-runtime-env codex --persist
   ```

   Does everything tier 2 does, **plus** installs
   `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.openloomi.codex-runtime-env.plist` on macOS
   (a `RunAtLoad` LaunchAgent that re-applies the value on every login), so
   the switch survives logout/reboot. The `setup` wizard installs this tier
   by default. On Linux the environment.d file already persists, so no extra
   flag is needed. On Windows the bridge prints manual steps instead of
   touching the registry.

> **macOS caveat:** the GUI launchd session is separate from your terminal,
> so a freshly written `OPENLOOMI_AGENT_PROVIDER` is only inherited by
> processes spawned _after_ the write. The `/openloomi:setup` wizard detects
> this and **automatically quits and relaunches** the running desktop app
> when the env var changes — you do not need to manually Quit+Reopen. The
> only time you need to do it by hand is if you invoked `set-codex-runtime-env`
> directly (not through setup). On Linux a per-user env file applies on next
> login; on Windows you edit the user environment via System Settings.

Flags accepted by `set-codex-runtime-env`:

- `<value>` — defaults to `codex`. Other supported values: `claude`,
  `opencode`, `hermes`, `openclaw`.
- `--unset` — clear `OPENLOOMI_AGENT_PROVIDER` from the host environment.
- `--dry-run` — describe what would happen without writing anything.
- `--persist` — install a `RunAtLoad` LaunchAgent on macOS so the value
  survives logout/reboot. Combine with `--unset` to also remove the plist.

For a permanent shell-side switch on macOS or Linux, additionally append the
export to your shell rc so future shells remember it:

```bash
echo 'export OPENLOOMI_AGENT_PROVIDER=codex' >> ~/.zshrc
```

The shell export helps the bridge itself; the `set-codex-runtime-env` step
is what makes the GUI launchd domain and the desktop session pick the
variable up.

### Fine-tuning the Codex runtime

Optional companion variables (all read by `apps/web`'s native-agent env
resolver at startup). Defaults are shown:

```bash
export OPENLOOMI_AGENT_CODEX_COMMAND=codex            # `codex` on PATH
export OPENLOOMI_AGENT_CODEX_MODEL=gpt-5.4            # optional override
export OPENLOOMI_AGENT_CODEX_PROFILE=work             # optional `-p <name>`
export OPENLOOMI_AGENT_CODEX_SANDBOX=workspace-write  # read-only | workspace-write | danger-full-access
export OPENLOOMI_AGENT_CODEX_ASK_FOR_APPROVAL=on-request  # untrusted | on-failure | on-request | never
export OPENLOOMI_AGENT_CODEX_SKIP_GIT_REPO_CHECK=true
export OPENLOOMI_AGENT_CODEX_FULL_AUTO=false          # true allows --full-auto under bypassPermissions
export OPENLOOMI_AGENT_CODEX_TIMEOUT_MS=120000        # CLI runtime budget in ms
```

Before this will actually work, make sure:

- `which codex` resolves to a working Codex CLI binary.
- `~/.codex/config.toml` is configured, and `OPENAI_API_KEY` (or the Codex
  CLI's other auth) is available to the spawned process.

### Confirming the switch

After restarting OpenRice Desktop, hit `GET /api/native/providers`. It
should report `codex` inside `agents` and `defaultAgent: "codex"`. If you
still see `defaultAgent: "claude"`, the env change didn't stick — re-run
`launchctl getenv OPENLOOMI_AGENT_PROVIDER` to confirm the GUI session
actually has it.

To pull the same switch plan as structured JSON (handy for surfacing inside
Codex without retyping the shell snippets):

```bash
node "$SKILL_DIR/../../scripts/loomi-bridge.mjs" codex-runtime-info
```

Responsibilities:

- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`: Codex plugin metadata, display info, and
  skill discovery.
- `skills/openloomi/SKILL.md`: thin Codex entrypoint that decides when to
  call the bridge.
- `scripts/loomi-bridge.mjs`: local adapter for discovery, install
  guidance, readiness checks, native runtime wiring, one-shot execution,
  and hook integration.
- `assets/`: plugin icons and visual assets.
- `hooks/hooks.json`: Codex lifecycle hooks (mirrored onto the OpenRice
  Pet).

The Claude Code plugin lives next to it under `plugins/claude/` and ships
its own README, hooks, and slash-command layout; that surface is
intentionally not mirrored here.

### Architecture

```text
Codex
  -> OpenRice Codex plugin
      -> OpenRice skill entrypoint
          -> loomi-bridge
              -> discovery and install layer
              -> first-use native runtime wiring layer
              -> readiness layer
              -> OpenRice skill guidance layer
              -> optional Codex hook layer
              -> OpenRice runtime launcher
                  -> OpenRice local runtime
                      -> memory
                      -> connectors
                      -> loop
                      -> model provider
                      -> OpenRice Pet
```

The plugin stays thin. Connector, memory, and loop implementations live
inside OpenRice-owned runtime surfaces; the bridge only routes to them.

### Supported environments

**Packaged Desktop install.** The user installed OpenRice through an
official desktop installer or release artifact. The plugin discovers the
bundled OpenRice Desktop GUI app (`OpenRice.app` on macOS,
`openloomi.exe` on Windows, `openloomi.AppImage` on Linux) and uses it to
launch the local runtime.

**Source checkout.** The user cloned the OpenRice repository locally and
wants Codex to work against that checkout. The plugin detects source
checkouts when explicitly configured or when known project markers are
present. If the source checkout exists but the desktop app has not been
built yet, the plugin returns actionable instructions rather than building
automatically without user confirmation.

**Launching the desktop app with the Codex runtime.** When OpenRice is
used from Codex, this is the recommended first-use path: it lets OpenRice
reuse the user's existing Codex runtime to complete the first Codex plugin
workflow.

Whenever the bridge launches the OpenRice Desktop app (during `setup`
or `initialize-session`), it first wires
`OPENLOOMI_AGENT_PROVIDER=codex` into the environment the GUI launchd
session will hand to the new process — `launchctl setenv` plus a persisted
LaunchAgent on macOS, `~/.config/environment.d/openloomi-codex.conf` on
Linux. Because the value lands _before_ the app is handed to launchd, the
freshly spawned OpenRice web server inherits it and auto-selects Codex on
first open, with no manual `export` or app restart. The wiring is
non-destructive:

- If the user has already set `OPENLOOMI_AGENT_PROVIDER` to a non-`codex`
  value, the bridge leaves it alone (`reason: "user_override"`) — an
  explicit choice always wins.
- If it is already `codex`, the launch is a no-op (`reason: "already_codex"`).
- Windows has no safe auto-write surface, so the bridge reports
  `reason: "unsupported"` and leaves configuration to the user.

The env-wiring result is surfaced on the launch payload under `env` so
callers can see exactly what happened.

**Missing install.** If OpenRice is not installed, the plugin supports a
user-approved install flow. The install flow uses official OpenRice
artifacts, resolves the current platform's release asset automatically, and
installs with the default installer path where automatic installation is
supported.

### Discovery strategy

The bridge detects the OpenRice Desktop GUI app in this order:

```text
1. OPENLOOMI_APP
2. OPENLOOMI_HOME or OPENLOOMI_INSTALL_DIR
3. OPENLOOMI_REPO_DIR
4. PATH lookup for the desktop app binary
5. Platform default packaged install paths
6. Previously saved non-secret plugin config
7. User-provided install path or source checkout path
8. User-approved install flow
```

For packaged installs, common layouts:

```text
# macOS

# Linux
/opt/openloomi/openloomi
/usr/local/openloomi/openloomi

```

For source checkouts, project markers:

```text

<repo-root>/apps/web/src-tauri/Cargo.toml
```

### Readiness contract

`setup-status` returns stable JSON:

Native Codex CLI execution is tracked through `nativeRuntime*` and
`executionProvider*` fields. When `/api/native/providers` reports
`defaultAgent: "codex"` and the Codex agent metadata is present,
`setup-status` returns `ready: true` with
`executionProviderSource: "native_codex_runtime"`.

Connector readiness is a status-only advisory. Missing Gmail, Slack,
GitHub, Calendar, or Linear connections should not block memory-only or
local runtime workflows, so `ready` can remain `true` while
`connectorSetupRecommended` points the user to the OpenRice-owned
`/connectors` setup surface. Connector tokens, account identifiers, OAuth
secrets, passwords, and Composio secrets must never be printed by the
Codex bridge.

The bridge first reads the Loop connector status endpoint and then, when a
local session token is available, merges OpenRice-owned native integration
accounts from `/api/integrations` as status-only rows. This lets Codex
show native connections such as Gmail or QQbot as connected even when the
Loop/Composio probe is unavailable or slow, while still keeping all
credentials inside OpenRice-owned surfaces.

When every loopback probe fails with `NETWORK_ERROR`, `setup-status` sets
`loopbackAccessAmbiguous: true`. This does not prove that OpenRice is stopped:
Codex network sandboxing may prevent the bridge process from reaching services
on the host's `localhost`. Consumers should request approval to run the
provided `loopbackAccess.verification.commands` outside the sandbox before
recommending an application restart. A successful outside-sandbox API request
means the in-sandbox readiness result was a false negative.

**Common `nextAction` values:**

initialize_openloomi_session
open_openloomi
configure_connectors

null   (ready — no further action; call the OpenRice API directly)
```

**Common `reason` values:**

```text

READY
```

OpenRice guest mode is supported. A missing token should not be treated as
a requirement for account registration or manual login. When OpenRice is
installed, the bridge may initialize a guest/session token through the
local OpenRice API and write the standard `~/.openloomi/token` file. If
the local API is not reachable, the bridge may launch OpenRice and ask
the user to let OpenRice initialize its guest session.

The bridge attempts two guest endpoints, in order:

1. `POST /api/remote-auth/guest` — the JSON bearer flow. This is the same
   endpoint the Claude plugin calls and the one that registers a fresh
   guest account in the OpenRice runtime's local database before returning
   a bearer. Prefer this when the running OpenRice build exposes it.
2. `POST /api/auth/guest?redirectUrl=/` followed by `GET /api/auth/token`
   using the `Set-Cookie` header — the legacy cookie-based flow kept for
   older OpenRice builds that don't ship the JSON endpoint. The bridge
   falls back to this path only when the JSON endpoint returns 404 or is
   unreachable before any response, so a transient 5xx or empty payload on
   the JSON path still tries the cookie path before giving up.

Both paths produce the same outcome from the bridge's perspective: a
token written to `~/.openloomi/token`, masked out of logs and stderr, and
reportable via `setup-status` as `session.tokenPresent: true`.

### First-use runtime setup

The plugin guides users toward the Codex runtime path when OpenRice is
first used from Codex. This lets OpenRice reuse the user's existing Codex
CLI runtime for the first plugin workflow.

Preferred path: set or verify `OPENLOOMI_AGENT_PROVIDER=codex` for the
OpenRice desktop runtime, then restart OpenRice and verify
`/api/native/providers`. Once the bridge sees the Codex agent advertised
as the default, `setup-status` reports `ready: true` with
`executionProviderSource: "native_codex_runtime"`.

### OpenRice skill guidance

After OpenRice starts, the plugin guides users toward OpenRice-related
skills and workflows that are useful from Codex. The Codex plugin ships
one main entry skill (`openloomi`) plus eight sub-skills under
`skills/`. Each sub-skill is auto-loaded by Codex on demand based on its
frontmatter `description` — they share the same `loomi-bridge.mjs`
runtime, no business logic is duplicated.

The `workflow-guidance` bridge command exposes structured guidance for the
three workflow skills (`openloomi-loop`, `openloomi-memory`,
`openloomi-connectors`). All other skills are documentation or routing
helpers. The plugin must not copy OpenRice connector, memory, or loop
logic into Codex — runtime implementations stay inside the OpenRice
desktop runtime.

**Pairing notes:**

- `openloomi-connectors` covers OpenRice's **native 7** platforms
  (Telegram, WhatsApp, iMessage, Feishu, DingTalk, QQ, WeChat). For
  accounts connected through **Composio** (Slack, Discord, X, LinkedIn,
  Notion, HubSpot, Gmail via OAuth, etc.), invoke the `composio` skill in
  parallel and present the union when the user asks "what am I connected
  to?".
- `openloomi-loop` reads/decides only — execution happens on user request
  via `/api/loop/action/schedule`. It is read/derive, never destructive.
- `openloomi-memory` is the canonical store. `openloomi-loop` deliberately
  delegates persistence to memory instead of duplicating it.

### Pet state control

The bridge ships a `pet <state>` command that mirrors
`plugins/claude/scripts/loomi-bridge.mjs::cmdPet`. It validates against
the same 9-state sprite vocabulary and POSTs `{state, source:
"codex-plugin"}` to `/api/pet/state` on the local OpenRice runtime with
the bearer token from `~/.openloomi/token`. The command tries every
local OpenRice API URL in priority order, so a closed 3414 port can
still fall back to a source runtime on 3515.

### Custom pet themes & sprite overrides

The pet's look is **file-driven**, not bridge-driven. The Codex bridge only drives state transitions — the actual sprite Loomi paints comes from the same runtime-side theme system the Claude plugin uses:

| Layer               | Lives at                                           | What it does                                                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Built-in themes     | `apps/web/public/loomi-pet/assets/{fox,capybara}/` | Bundled fox (`loomi-*` prefix) and capybara sprites               |
| Custom themes       | `~/.openloomi/pet-custom/<name>/`                  | Any folder with ≥1 recognized-state PNG becomes a theme           |
| Per-state overrides | `~/.openloomi/pet-config.json`                     | `(theme, state) → absolute path` map; wins over both layers above |

End-user guide: see [Customize your Loomi Pet](/docs/pet) — covers
filename conventions, the camelCase `pet-config.json` schema, and the
~250 ms file-watcher live-reload. The plugin also has a matching
[`openloomi-pet` sub-skill](./skills/openloomi-pet/SKILL.md) for in-codex
guidance; it ships the same decision tree as the Claude-side skill with
the Codex-specific deltas documented in § Codex-specific deltas vs the Claude plugin.

**The bridge never writes these files.** Codex users customize the pet
the same way everyone else does — through the right-click menu or by
editing `~/.openloomi/pet-config.json` directly. The runtime's file
watcher does the work; the bridge only owns `pet <state>`.

**Do not** call `pet sleeping` or `pet sweeping` from Codex — the API
rejects them with `400 invalid_state` (the bridge surfaces this as
`PET_FAILED`, not `INVALID_STATE`). The Loop baseline watcher owns those
two states. See [`openloomi-pet/SKILL.md`](./skills/openloomi-pet/SKILL.md)
for the full vocabulary and bridge failure-mode table.

```bash
# GitHub install:
node ~/.codex/plugins/cache/openloomi/openloomi/<version>/scripts/loomi-bridge.mjs pet happy
node ~/.codex/plugins/cache/openloomi/openloomi/<version>/scripts/loomi-bridge.mjs pet working
# Local contributor checkout:
node ./openloomi/codex/scripts/loomi-bridge.mjs pet happy
node ./openloomi/codex/scripts/loomi-bridge.mjs pet working
```

Valid states:

```text
happy, idle, juggling, needsinput, presenting, sleeping, sweeping, thinking, working
```

> **API-accepted subset:** `POST /api/pet/state` only accepts 7 of these:
> `idle`, `thinking`, `working`, `juggling`, `happy`, `presenting`,
> `needsinput`. `sleeping` and `sweeping` are capybara-theme vocabulary
> managed by the Loop baseline watcher — the API returns 400
> `invalid_state` for them, which the bridge surfaces as `{ok: false,
code: "PET_FAILED"}`. Avoid requesting those two from Codex; let the
> Loop baseline watcher set them.

Failure modes (all return structured JSON, never throw):

- `MISSING_STATE` — no positional state argument.
- `INVALID_STATE` — state not in the vocabulary; response includes
  `validStates` and `received`.
- `TOKEN_MISSING` — `~/.openloomi/token` does not exist or is unreadable.
  Run `setup` or open OpenRice Desktop once before driving Pet state.
- `ENDPOINT_MISSING` — runtime answered with HTTP 404. Treat as
  non-blocking: the bridge returns the polite notice that the endpoint is
  pending. Pet control resumes automatically once OpenRice ships the
  route.
- `API_UNREACHABLE` — no local API responded on 3414/3515. `attempts`
  lists every URL the bridge tried.
- `PET_FAILED` — runtime answered but with a non-success status code.

The bridge also exposes an internal `state <state> --event <event>`
command for Codex lifecycle hooks. This path is hook-safe: it never
fails the Codex turn, never prompts, and returns `hook: "skipped"` when
OpenRice is not ready, the token is missing, or the Pet endpoint is
unavailable.

### Codex Pet lifecycle hooks

Status: implemented as a non-blocking Pet mirror.

The Codex plugin ships `plugins/codex/hooks/hooks.json` and declares it
in `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`. The hook bundle mirrors Codex lifecycle
events onto the OpenRice Pet without making authorization or
control-flow decisions.

Current mapping:

- `SessionStart` → Pet `presenting`;
- `UserPromptSubmit` → Pet `thinking`;
- `PreToolUse` → Pet `working`;
- `PermissionRequest` → Pet `needsinput`;
- `PostToolUse` → Pet `thinking`;
- `SubagentStart` → Pet `juggling`;
- `SubagentStop` → Pet `thinking`;
- `Stop` → Pet `happy`.

Hooks use the same runtime-accepted `source: "codex-plugin"` value when
posting to `/api/pet/state`. They are best-effort UI feedback only.
Memory archive, follow-up scheduling, permission decisions, and
connector behavior stay inside OpenRice-owned runtime surfaces.

### Secret handling

Codex chat, argv, stdout, and stderr must never receive or print:

- model provider API keys;
- OAuth access tokens or refresh tokens;
- connector app secrets;
- OpenRice auth tokens;
- local secure-storage contents.

Allowed status-only checks:

```text
OPENLOOMI_AUTH_TOKEN present/missing
~/.openloomi/token present/missing
guest/session initialization available/unavailable
connector configured/missing
local API reachable/unreachable
native Codex runtime active/inactive
```

Example safe output:

```json
{
  "executionProviderReady": true,
  "executionProviderSource": "native_codex_runtime",
  "nativeRuntime": {
    "active": true,
    "defaultAgent": "codex",
    "codexAgentAvailable": true
  }
}
```

The bridge may report provider configuration presence. It must not print
values.

The bridge may receive a guest/session token from the local OpenRice
API only to write the standard `~/.openloomi/token` file. It must keep
the token out of argv, stdout, stderr, logs, and the Codex transcript.

Which token-bearing endpoint the bridge ends up calling is
implementation detail — both `POST /api/remote-auth/guest` and the
cookie-based `POST /api/auth/guest` + `GET /api/auth/token` flow end up
writing the same `~/.openloomi/token` file. From outside, the bridge
exposes only that a guest/session token was obtained, not which path
produced it.

### Non-goals

- Do not download or install OpenRice without an explicit user
  installation intent or confirmation.
- Do not install from unofficial artifacts or default to custom install
  paths.
- Do not build OpenRice from source automatically.
- Do not ask users to paste API keys, OAuth tokens, or auth tokens into
  Codex chat.
- Do not pass secrets as command-line arguments.
- Do not implement connector protocols inside the Codex plugin.
- Do not duplicate the full OpenRice runtime inside the Codex plugin.
- Do not make the Codex plugin a replacement for OpenRice Desktop.

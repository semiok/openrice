# OpenRice Install Sub-skill

This sub-skill is auto-loaded when the user wants to install or fix OpenRice
on their machine. It composes `loomi-bridge` operations and never downloads
or executes anything outside the plugin's own scripts.

## Quick workflow

1. `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/loomi-bridge.mjs setup-status --json`
2. Based on `nextAction` / `reason`:

| Reason / nextAction | Action |
|---|---|
| `OPENLOOMI_NOT_INSTALLED` | Run `loomi-bridge install [--yes]` after explicit y/N — OpenRice Desktop is not on this machine. For offline / corporate-proxy installs, point the user at the restricted-network guide (link below). |
| `OPENLOOMI_NOT_FINALIZED` / `launch_openloomi_to_finalize` | OpenRice.app is installed (`desktopMarker` set) but the helper binary isn't on disk yet. Tell the user to launch OpenRice once (macOS: `open -a "<desktopMarker>"`) so it lays down the helper, then re-run `/openloomi:setup`. **Do NOT install.** |
| `LOGIN_REQUIRED` | Ask user to open OpenRice Desktop to sign in. Run `setup-status` again afterwards. |
| `AI_PROVIDER_REQUIRED` | OpenRice has no authenticated Claude runtime and no per-user provider row. Point the user at running `claude auth login` (then re-run `/openloomi:setup`), or at OpenRice Desktop → API Settings for a custom endpoint. |
| `SOURCE_FOUND_CLI_NOT_BUILT` | Show the build instructions from the OpenRice repo's Tauri build docs (or run `loomi-bridge install-instructions`) or recommend running the bundled installer instead. |
| `READY` | Nothing to do. |

## Reminder: secrets contract

- This plugin never handles AI provider API keys. AI provider
  configuration lives in the OpenRice runtime itself; the runtime
  detects the user's local `claude` CLI auth on its own.
- If the user pastes a key into chat, redact it: do NOT echo it back,
  and tell them to remove it from chat history.
- Never pass `--api-key` as an argv flag — there's no such flag in the
  plugin, by design.

# OpenRice Connectors Skill

OpenRice Connectors handle two directions: **pulling Signals in** from your authorized platforms and **pushing approved Actions back out** through the same channel. OpenRice ships them through two layers:

- **Native (this skill)** — 7 messaging-platform bots maintained directly by OpenRice: Telegram, WhatsApp, iMessage, Lark/Feishu, DingTalk, QQ, and WeChat. The `openloomi-connectors` CLI covers OAuth / app-credential / QR / interactive setup, list, status, disconnect, contact query, and message send for these.
- **Composio (paired `composio` skill)** — a hosted OAuth broker that authorizes ~1000+ apps including Slack, Discord, X, Gmail, Outlook, Google Calendar/Drive/Docs, GitHub, Notion, Linear, HubSpot, LinkedIn, Jira, Asana. Composio handles **"is this user authorised?"** and stores the tokens; OpenRice's Loop channels consume the events as Signals (see [Glossary — Composio / Loop channel](https://openloomi.ai/docs/glossary)).

When the user asks "what am I connected to?" or "list my accounts", run **both** — `list-accounts` here **and** the composio connection listing — and present the union. Keep auth, OAuth, and disconnect flows native to each skill.

This skill does **not** manage Loop channels, custom decision types, or classifier rules — those are `openloomi-loop`'s job.

## What is openloomi?

OpenRice is an **open-source AI coworker, driven by an attention agent** — a desktop app (Loomi) that connects your authorized tools, builds a local knowledge graph of people / projects / decisions, and surfaces the day's decisions as one-tap bubbles you Approve. It runs locally (local-first, AES-256), supports Skills + Plugins so any Agent Runtime (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Hermes, OpenClaw) can plug into the same resident desktop. See `openloomi-feature-guide` for the full picture.

### Continuous sync

Connectors are the **per-platform input** that Loop reads on every tick. When you authorize a platform, OpenRice continuously syncs (with your permission):

- Raw messages and communications
- Meetings and calendar events
- Emails and tweets
- Voice calls
- Notes, screen captures, and captured ideas

The aggregated stream feeds OpenRice's Memory and the Signals Loop polls on every tick — so an unprompted reminder, a contextual reply draft, or a Decision Card arrives with full historical grounding instead of starting from scratch.

## Supported Platforms (7)

The CLI `list-platforms` returns these 7 platforms. Other connectable
platforms (Slack, Discord, X, Gmail, Outlook, LinkedIn, Google Calendar,
Google Drive, Google Docs, HubSpot, Notion, etc.) are managed via the
desktop UI or the `composio` skill — see "Platform Connection Methods"
below for details.

| ID | Display Name | Aliases |
|----|-------------|---------|
| `telegram` | Telegram | tg |
| `whatsapp` | WhatsApp | |
| `imessage` | iMessage | |
| `feishu` | Lark/Feishu | lark, 飞书 |
| `dingtalk` | DingTalk | 钉钉 |
| `qqbot` | QQ | qq, qq_bot |
| `weixin` | WeChat | wechat, 微信, wechat_work, wecom, 企业微信 |

---

## Authentication

The CLI auto-reads your token from `~/.openloomi/token` (base64 encoded JWT).

### Local API Access

The local API server runs on port **3414** (fallback: **3515**). If 3414 is unavailable, try 3515.

---

## API Endpoints

### Integration Accounts

#### GET `/api/integrations/accounts` - List Connected Accounts

Returns all connected platform accounts for the authenticated user.

```bash
curl http://localhost:3414/api/integrations/accounts \

```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "accounts": [
    {
      "id": "int_xxx",

## Platform Aliases Reference

Aliases are case-insensitive and support both English and Chinese:

| Alias | Platform |
|-------|----------|
| `tg` | telegram |
| `wechat`, `微信` | weixin |
| `lark`, `飞书` | feishu |
| `钉钉` | dingtalk |
| `qq`, `qq_bot` | qqbot |

---

## Desktop UI

Users can also authorize accounts directly through the openloomi desktop application without using CLI commands.

### Adding Account Authorization via Desktop UI

1. **Open openloomi desktop app** on your computer
2. **Navigate to Settings** (gear icon in the sidebar or top-right menu)
3. **Go to Integrations** tab/section
4. **Click on the platform** you want to connect (e.g., Telegram, Slack, Discord, Gmail, etc.)
5. **Follow the platform-specific authorization flow:**
   - **OAuth platforms** (Slack, Discord, X/Twitter): Click "Connect" → you'll be redirected to the platform's authorization page in your browser → Approve the permissions → you'll be redirected back
   - **App Password platforms** (Gmail, Outlook): Enter your email and app password
   - **App Credentials platforms** (DingTalk, Feishu, QQ): Enter your appId and appSecret
   - **QR/Interactive platforms** (WhatsApp, Telegram, iMessage): Scan the QR code or follow the in-app instructions

6. **Verify connection** — once authorized, the platform will show as "Connected" with a green checkmark

### Managing Connected Accounts

- **List connected accounts**: Settings → Integrations → shows all connected platforms with status
- **Disconnect account**: Settings → Integrations → click on connected platform → "Disconnect" or remove
- **Check status**: Connected platforms show green "Active" badge; expired/disconnected shows red "Inactive" badge

## AI Agent Workflow

**Triggered when the user asks about:**

1. Connecting a platform - "connect telegram", "link my slack"
2. Listing integrations - "show my connected accounts", "what platforms am I connected to"
3. Checking status - "is my github connected?", "telegram status"
4. Disconnecting - "disconnect my discord", "remove whatsapp"
5. Querying contacts - "show my contacts", "find John in contacts"
6. Sending messages - "send email to John", "reply to that message"
7. Cross-source account audit - "show everything I'm connected to (openloomi + composio)", "list all linked accounts across both" → run `list-accounts` here **and** the `composio` skill in parallel, then present the union

**Execution Flow:**

1. **Identify intent** - connect / list / status / disconnect / query-contacts / send-reply
2. **Resolve platform** - use alias normalization (e.g., `gh` -> `github`)
3. **Execute command** - use Bash tool
4. **Format output** - report results naturally in user's language

**Note on send-reply:** The `botId` is returned by `list-accounts` in the `botId` field.

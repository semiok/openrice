# OpenRice Product Features

Use this skill when users ask about openloomi features, usage, or capabilities. Provide accurate and easy-to-understand feature introductions and operation guides. The terms used here (Loop, Signal, Decision, Card, ActionKind, Attention Agent, Connector, Memory, Audit Log, Plugin, Agent Runtime, Composio, etc.) are defined in the **Glossary** below — read it first if a user asks anything conceptual.

---

## What is OpenRice

OpenRice is an **open-source AI coworker, driven by an attention agent**. It connects your authorized work tools and screen content, builds a **holistic context** of your people, projects, and decisions, and tells you what happened, why it matters, what to do next — and surfaces daily summaries — saving your attention for what matters.

Use it standalone, or plug any Agent framework into the same resident desktop: **Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Hermes, and OpenClaw** all work. The desktop attention agent (a small fox named **Loomi**) lives on top of your screen and surfaces the day's decisions as gentle bubbles you can approve in one tap.

---

## Glossary

OpenRice is best read as a single **chain from input to action**, not as one big chat window. Connectors bring events in, Memory holds context, Loop decides what matters and turns each signal into a Decision card, the Attention Agent (Loomi) shows the card on your desktop, you tap Approve, and an Action Runner executes through a Connector — then the outcome is written back to Memory and recorded in the Audit Log.

This page exists to make that chain legible. It first walks the chain end-to-end, then defines every concept you're likely to meet in other pages, and finishes with a short table of distinctions that get confused in practice. Every cross-reference links to an existing page; nothing here duplicates their full setup or configuration.

### How the concepts fit together

OpenRice is one pipeline. The same pieces appear on every page, just framed differently.

Two parallel input paths feed the same context layer. The main one is real-time and runs through Loop; the side one is screen-based and lands in Memory without going through Signals.

![OpenRice concept map — Inputs (Connectors and Screen Capture) feed Signals into the Judgement & Store pillar (Loop and Memory), which produces Decisions; the Surface & Action pillar renders Cards in the Attention Agent, waits for user Approve, and runs Actions through Connectors; everything writes back to Memory and the Audit Log.](https://openloomi.ai/img/openloomi/glossary/concepts.svg)

A short reading guide for the figure:

- **Connectors** are the real-time input path: they pull raw events from external platforms and turn them into **Signals**, which **Loop** polls on its tick. Everything that becomes a Decision card comes in this way.
- **Screen Capture** (macOS only) is the side input path: pressing the global capture shortcut summarises the frontmost window and the result is stored directly as a **Memory** record. Screen memories show up alongside messages, summaries, and insights inside Memory; they do **not** flow through Signals and Loop won't tick on them.
- **Memory** is the long-lived context layer: people, projects, prior decisions, summaries, insights, screen memories, and Knowledge Base chunks. **Loop** reads the relevant slice before it judges; **Chat** reads Memory through retriever skills; the result of every approved action is written back into Memory.
- **Loop** is the only thing that produces **Decisions**. A Decision is the typed judgement ("this email needs a reply", "this PR needs a review"), and a **Card** is how that judgement looks in the UI.
- The **Attention Agent** (also called **Loomi**, the **pet**, or the **fox**) is the messenger. It surfaces cards on the desktop. It does no judging of its own.
- You always tap **Approve** before anything runs. After approval, an **Action Runner** calls a **Connector** to actually send mail / post the comment / update the ticket.
- The result lands back in **Memory** (so the next Loop tick has sharper context) and in the **Audit Log** (so you can see who did what and when).

#### Worked example — "An email needs a reply"

> 9:12 AM. Sarah writes: "Hi — I tweaked tomorrow's Q2 review agenda, can you take a look? Also, I'd like to move our Wednesday 1:1 to Thursday same time — works for you?"

Step by step through the chain:

| Step          | Where it happens                                               | What is produced                                                               |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Ingest     | Gmail **Connector**                                            | A raw **Signal** — a new email event                                           |
| 2. Enrich     | **Memory** + **Screen Capture** (if you had related tabs open) | A context slice: who Sarah is, the Q2 project note, last thread summary        |
| 3. Judge      | **Loop** tick                                                  | A typed **Decision** — `email_reply`, confidence `0.85`                        |
| 4. Surface    | **Attention Agent** bubble, main-window queue, pet card        | A **Card** with subject, sender, draft preview, the four-button tray           |
| 5. Approve    | You tap **Approve**                                            | The **Action Runner** for `email_reply` is invoked                             |
| 6. Execute    | Gmail **Connector** (send)                                     | The reply is sent                                                              |
| 7. Write back | **Memory** + **Audit Log**                                     | Sarah's profile, the thread cluster, and the day's audit entry are all updated |

### Core concepts

These are the terms that anchor every other page.

#### Connector

A **Connector** is the integration boundary between OpenRice and an external platform — Gmail, Outlook, Telegram, WhatsApp, iMessage, Slack, GitHub, Linear, Calendar, Notion, and so on. Connectors handle both directions: pulling raw events out of the platform so the rest of the system can see them, and pushing actions back in once you approve them. See [Connectors](https://openloomi.ai/docs/connectors).

#### Signal

A **Signal** is one raw event produced by a **Connector** — "email arrived", "calendar invite received", "@mention on Telegram", "PR review requested". Signals are unopinionated: they carry the payload from the source platform and a shape so the rest of OpenRice can reason about them. They are the only thing Loop consumes. (Screen Capture is a separate input — see [Memory](#memory).)

#### Memory

**Memory** is OpenRice's long-lived context layer — people, projects, prior decisions, summaries, insights, uploaded documents, and **Screen Capture** memories — held locally on your machine. Both **Chat** and **Loop** read from Memory to ground their answers in your history, and approved Actions write back into Memory so the next judgement has sharper context. See [Memory](https://openloomi.ai/docs/memory).

#### Loop

**Loop** is OpenRice's proactive judgement engine. On a regular tick it pulls **Signals** from connected sources, reads the matching slice of **Memory**, and turns the ones that need you into typed **Decisions**. Loop never executes anything itself — it only "sees, thinks, and queues a card". Default cadence is every 10 minutes; tune it via `PUT /api/loop/preferences`. See [Loop](https://openloomi.ai/docs/loop).

#### Decision

A **Decision** is the smallest unit Loop produces — one signal becomes one structured judgement. A Decision carries a typed action (for example `email_reply`, `rsvp`, `review_pr`, `im_reply`, `todo`), a confidence score, a short preview of the proposed action, and any sender / subject / memory slice that's relevant.

#### Card

A **Card** is what a **Decision** looks like in the UI. A Card has the typed action, the confidence score, a preview body, the four-button tray (**Approve / Edit Draft / Later / Skip**), and — for any outbound action — a red "⚠ OUTBOUND" warning. Cards surface in three places at once: the main OpenRice window, the Attention Agent bubble, and the pet card. See [Loop — Approvals and dry-run](https://openloomi.ai/docs/loop#approvals-and-dry-run).

#### Action / ActionKind

An **Action** is the actual side effect that runs after you Approve a Card. The shape of an Action is fixed by an **`ActionKind`** literal — `email_reply`, `im_reply`, `calendar_rsvp`, `github_review`, `linear_review`, `todo`, `deadline_notify`, and a small set of others. Custom decision types register a label + icon, but always route to one of the built-in `ActionKind` runners.

#### Attention Agent / Loomi / Pet

The **Attention Agent** is the desktop companion — a 168×168, always-on-top, transparent little fox that lives on your desktop and shows Card bubbles when Loop queues something for you. **Loomi** is the fox's name; **Pet** is a generic nickname. The Attention Agent is **the messenger, not the judge**. See [Attention Agent](https://openloomi.ai/docs/attention-agent).

#### Audit Log

The **Audit Log** records the consequential moments of OpenRice's day: every Memory read/write, every Loop judgement, every Approve / Edit / Skip, every outbound Action invocation and its result, and every Connector authorization change. See [Privacy & Security — Audit Logs](https://openloomi.ai/docs/privacy-security#audit-logs).

### Supporting concepts

These are the surfaces and side capabilities that show up across the product.

#### Chat

**Chat** is the conversational entry point in the main OpenRice window. It solves "I have a question, a request, or a draft to write". It does **not** watch your day or queue cards — that's Loop's job. Chat reads Memory to ground answers and, when you tap **Edit Draft** on a Decision Card, you land here with the draft already loaded so you can refine it with the AI before Approving. See [Chat](https://openloomi.ai/docs/chat).

#### Automation

An **Automation** (also called a **Task** or **Scheduled Job**) is a prompt and schedule that **you** have defined in advance — "every weekday at 9 AM, summarise my unread inbox". Loop, by contrast, **discovers** Signals on its own and **judges** whether to surface them; Automation is the executor that runs whatever you told it to run. Both share the same scheduled-jobs runtime; Loop's own brief (9 AM) and wrap (6 PM) are themselves scheduled jobs. See [Automation](https://openloomi.ai/docs/automation).

#### Library / Knowledge Base

The **Library** is the user-facing surface; the **Knowledge Base** is what's behind it — the set of uploaded documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, Markdown, spreadsheets, slides, images) that you want OpenRice to reason over. Library is **explicit, user-uploaded context** and is **not** the whole of Memory. See [Library](https://openloomi.ai/docs/library).

#### Skills

**Skills** are reusable capabilities the agent can call when it needs to do something specific — code generation, PDF creation, data analysis, browser automation, search, image generation, and many more. Inside a Skill, OpenRice runs through its **Agent Runtime**; Skills are how those runtimes are reached from Chat, Loop, or Automation. See [Skills](https://openloomi.ai/docs/skills).

#### Agent Runtime

An **Agent Runtime** is the underlying execution environment OpenRice uses when it needs a model that can act — Claude Agent SDK (the default), Codex CLI, OpenCode, Hermes, or OpenClaw. Runtime selection is deployment configuration. Agent Runtime powers Skills; **Plugins** (below) are the inverse bridge that lets those runtimes call OpenRice. See [Agent Runtimes](https://openloomi.ai/docs/reference/agent-runtimes).

#### Plugin

A **Plugin** is a thin bridge in the opposite direction: it lets an external agent shell (Claude Code, Codex CLI) call **into** the local OpenRice runtime. Once installed, Memory, Connectors, scheduled jobs, and the Pet become reachable as slash commands, skills, or `@OpenRice` prompts inside your existing shell. A Plugin does not run OpenRice's models — it just exposes OpenRice to the shell you already live in. See [Plugins](https://openloomi.ai/docs/plugins).

#### Composio / Loop channel

**Composio** is the hosted OAuth broker that authorizes several Connector flows behind the scenes (Google Calendar / Docs / Drive, GitHub, Notion, Linear, HubSpot, Jira, Asana, Outlook Calendar, and similar). A **Loop channel** is the per-source subscription that tells Loop which platform to poll on which cadence and what shape the Signal should take. Composio handles **"is this user authorised?"**; Loop channels handle **"how often does Loop look, and what does each record look like?"**. Custom Loop channels today wrap a Composio toolkit + tool slug.

### Common distinctions

These are the pairs and triplets that get mixed up in conversation.

#### Connector vs Signal vs Loop channel

| Term             | What it is                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Connector**    | The integration with a platform — pull raw events in, push Actions out.                                                           |
| **Signal**       | One raw event emitted by a Connector and consumed by Loop. Screen Capture does **not** emit Signals; it lands in Memory directly. |
| **Loop channel** | Loop's per-source subscription record — cadence, `signalType`, `payloadShape`, throttled per channel.                             |

#### Memory vs Knowledge Base vs Insight

| Term               | Where it comes from                                                               | What it stores                                                                |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Memory**         | Built automatically by OpenRice from your Connectors, chats, and Screen Capture. | People, projects, prior decisions, summaries — long-lived context.            |
| **Knowledge Base** | Documents **you** upload through the Library surface.                             | Uploaded PDFs / docs / slides / sheets, chunked and embedded for retrieval.   |
| **Insight**        | AI-extracted structured records derived from chats and source messages.           | High-level facts, events, decisions — with their own weighting and lifecycle. |

All three are searchable and feed Chat and Loop; only Memory is built automatically without an explicit upload step.

#### Decision vs Card vs ActionKind

| Term           | What it is                                                                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Decision**   | The structured judgement Loop produces — typed action + confidence + preview.                          |
| **Card**       | The UI rendering of a Decision — the bubble, the queue entry, the four-button tray.                    |
| **ActionKind** | The fixed runner literal — `email_reply`, `im_reply`, `calendar_rsvp`, etc. — that runs after Approve. |

In short: Loop emits **Decisions**, the UI shows **Cards**, and the runner that executes uses an **`ActionKind`**.

#### Loop vs Automation

| Term           | When it runs                                                | What decides the action                                                |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Loop**       | Continuously, on a tick (default every 10 minutes).         | The agent judges Signals against Memory and proposes a typed Decision. |
| **Automation** | On a fixed schedule you wrote — cron / interval / one-shot. | The exact prompt and parameters you saved in advance.                  |

Loop is the **discovery + judgement** layer; Automation is the **executor** for work you already know you want done.

#### Attention Agent vs Loop

| Term                | Role                                                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Loop**            | The judgement engine — it produces Decisions.                             |
| **Attention Agent** | The desktop messenger — it surfaces Cards that Loop has already produced. |

The mnemonic used elsewhere in these docs: **Loop is the brain; Loomi is the bubble.** If you see a notification, Loop decided you should.

#### Plugin vs Agent Runtime

| Term              | Direction                                                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Plugin**        | External agent shells (Claude Code, Codex CLI) **call into** OpenRice.         |
| **Agent Runtime** | OpenRice **calls into** an external runtime to execute Skills and Agent tasks. |

They look similar because they share the word "agent", but they point in opposite directions.

#### Loomi / Pet / Fox and the Attention Agent

| Term                | Meaning                                                                                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Attention Agent** | The product-level name for the desktop layer that surfaces Decision Cards.                                          |
| **Loomi**           | The default fox sprite's name; by extension, used as a nickname for the whole surface.                              |
| **Pet**             | Generic nickname for the same companion — used in the UI's right-click "Pause reminders" menu and similar surfaces. |
| **Fox**             | The default theme name; OpenRice also ships a `capybara` theme and supports custom themes.                         |

All four refer to the same desktop messenger — just different names a user might meet on different pages.

## Capability Highlights

### 🐾 Attention Agent

Loomi is a 168×168, always-on-top, transparent little fox that lives on your desktop. Every morning at 9 AM it slides today's to-do into view; every evening at 6 PM it shows what was handled for you during the day. It only nudges you in the moments that matter (an email past its reply window, a calendar invite past its RSVP window, a decision Loop queued for you) — and you always **Approve** before anything runs. Close the main OpenRice window and Loomi retreats to the system tray, still watching the door.

### 🧠 Holistic Context

OpenRice builds a persistent knowledge graph of people, projects, and decisions — short-, mid-, and long-term tiers that grow on their own. Six months later it still remembers the Q3 partnership direction confirmed with Sarah or the demo feedback from six weeks ago. Today when Sarah emails, the right slice is automatically pulled and a reply is drafted. You can always see and audit exactly what OpenRice remembers about you. See [Memory tiers and forgetting engine](https://openloomi.ai/docs/memory).

### 🔌 Platform Connectors

A continuous background sync pulls raw events from your authorized tools into the context graph: Email (Gmail, Outlook), IM (Telegram, WhatsApp, iMessage, QQ, Lark/Feishu, DingTalk), code review (GitHub, Linear), calendar (Google, Outlook), and more via the [Composio](https://openloomi.ai/docs/glossary#composio--loop-channel) OAuth broker. Connectors handle both directions — pulling Signals in, pushing approved Actions back out. See the [full list and per-platform setup flows](https://openloomi.ai/docs/connectors).

### ⏰ Proactive Tasks

Have AI run work on a schedule you write. Define a Task with a name, prompt, and schedule (cron / interval / one-shot) — Loop's own morning brief (9 AM) and evening wrap (6 PM) are themselves scheduled jobs. Enable/disable tasks, run them now, inspect execution history. See [Automation](https://openloomi.ai/docs/automation).

### 🧩 Any Agent Integration

OpenRice's runtime surfaces as open-source **Skills** (called from Chat, Loop, or Automation through an Agent Runtime) and **Plugins** (exposed to Claude Code / Codex CLI as `/openloomi:` slash commands and `@OpenRice` skills). Use OpenRice Desktop directly, or plug it into the agent shell you already live in — Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Hermes, or OpenClaw. See [Agent Runtimes](https://openloomi.ai/docs/reference/agent-runtimes) and [Plugins](https://openloomi.ai/docs/plugins).

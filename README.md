## OpenRice

**A local-first AI coworker for shared project memory and execution**

This repository is the independent OpenRice fork maintained at
[`semiok/openrice`](https://github.com/semiok/openrice). It currently preserves
upstream OpenLoomi data paths and plugin protocol for migration compatibility.

## What is OpenRice?

Your work is scattered across apps. OpenRice connects the tools you use and, with your permission, understands what’s on your screen. It brings together the context behind your people, projects, and decisions, then surfaces only what needs your decision or action.

**Focus on what matters. This is your Attention Agent.**

## What is it for?

An always-on desktop **attention agent** — the friendly desk companion Loomi — watches the door so you don't have to, and turns the day's scattered signals into decision cards you can approve in one tap. Use it standalone, or plug any Agent framework into the same resident desktop: Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Hermes, and OpenClaw all work.

- **Stop dropping commitments.** Overdue replies, creeping deadlines, "I'll send that follow-up Friday" — Loomi nudges you with a small bubble at the right moment, and you can teach it the signals and decisions to watch for.
- **Find anything from your work life in seconds.** "What did I decide about pricing last quarter?", "Who owns design on Acorn?", "What was I working on before vacation?" — memory spans every tool and channel, no more digging through Slack, Gmail, or Notion.
- **Morning brief at 9 AM, end-of-day recap at 6 PM.** Today's to-do slides into view every morning, today's done ships every evening — the key info lives in one place instead of nine apps.
- **Ask AI for work help right inside your chat.** Draft a reply, summarize a long thread, schedule a follow-up — directly in Telegram, WhatsApp, iMessage, QQ, or Lark/Feishu.

**Use as an Agent plugin** (for Claude Code / Codex users):

OpenRice ships official marketplace plugins that turn your existing agent into a front-end for the local OpenRice runtime.

| Agent       | Install                                                                                   | First-run setup                  |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Claude Code | `/plugin marketplace add melandlabs/plugins`<br>`/plugin install openloomi`               | `/openloomi:setup`               |
| Codex CLI   | `codex plugin marketplace add melandlabs/plugins && codex plugin add openloomi@openloomi` | `@OpenRice Run first-use setup.` |

The slim public marketplace lives at [`melandlabs/plugins`](https://github.com/melandlabs/plugins) so adding it only fetches the plugin payloads. See the plugin docs for full reference: [`plugins/claude`](https://openloomi.ai/docs/plugins/claude) · [`plugins/codex`](https://openloomi.ai/docs/plugins/codex).

**Use in skill-only agent runtimes**:

Install the OpenRice skill set directly from this repository:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/melandlabs/openloomi/tree/main/skills \
  --skill openloomi openloomi-setup openloomi-memory openloomi-connectors openloomi-loop openloomi-api openloomi-feature-guide composio \
  -y
```

Start with the `openloomi` or `openloomi-setup` skill. The first setup pass
checks whether OpenRice Desktop is installed, whether the local API is
reachable, and whether a local session token is available. If OpenRice
Desktop is missing, the skill points the user to the official Getting Started
guide and release downloads before continuing.

**Develop locally** (for developers):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/melandlabs/openloomi.git
cd openloomi

pnpm install
pnpm tauri:dev
```

Requires Node.js 22+, pnpm 9+, and Rust 1.75+. OpenRice does not publish or support Windows installers. For more platform-specific setup requirements, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Why It Is Different

**OpenRice is open-source and neutral.** Instead of locking you into a single vendor's agent, it integrates with any Agent Runtime — Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Hermes, OpenClaw — and brings a shared, cross-agent layer to all of them: a resident desktop **attention agent**, **holistic context memory**, **platform connectors**, and **proactive tasks**. Whichever agent you run, OpenRice watches the door, remembers what matters, and surfaces only the decisions worth your time — so you spend your attention on the work, not on chasing it.

| Claude Cowork-style agents | an open-source, local-first AI coworker and workspace with source evidence and approval                           |
| Codex / Claude Code        | workspace context beyond the repo: people, product decisions, launch context, issues, and follow-ups              |
| OpenClaw / Hermes          | context before and after the action: why it matters, what source was used, what changed, what remains open        |
| RAG / knowledge bases      | work state, not just document retrieval: what changed, what is still true, and what should affect the next action |
